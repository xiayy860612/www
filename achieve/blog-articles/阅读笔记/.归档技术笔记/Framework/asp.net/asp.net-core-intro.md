## Startup
- Startup Class, configures the request pipeline that handles all requests made to the application
- appsettings[.{env}].json, app settings configuration file
- bundleconfig.json, configuration files for bundling and minifying front-end JavaScript and CSS assets.
- wwwroot, Web application root folder for public static resources like css,js, ...

## Request Pipeline
Define request pipeline in **Startup::Configure** method
by config [Middleware][] to **IApplicationBuilder** instance.

**Startup::Configure** method specifies how the ASP.NET application
will respond to HTTP requests.

Request delegates are used to build the request pipeline and handle HTTP request.

Request delegates are configured using **Run, Map, and Use extension methods**
on the IApplicationBuilder instance in **Startup::Configure** method.
- Run, short-circuits the pipeline, not call next request delegate
- Map, branches request pipeline based on matches of the given request path.
If the request path starts with the given path, the branch is executed.
- Use, perform actions both before and after the next delegate

Middleware is constructed once **per application lifetime** at app startup.

**Startup::ConfigureServices** is optional, 
but usefull to config some service middlewares which used in **Startup::Configure**.
